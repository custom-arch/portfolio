    <h1>Twitch Channel Growth – Case Study</h1>
    <p class="tagline">From 0 to Twitch Partner - building a brand through content, community, and consistency.</p>

    <h2>Role & Context</h2>
    <p>
      As an independent content creator, I developed and scaled a personal Twitch brand that reached Partner status. 
      My channel focused on gaming, tech, and immersive character-based content, growing an engaged audience through strategic outreach and high-quality production.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In a saturated streaming market, standing out and building a loyal community required more than just going live. 
      I needed a strategy that combined engaging content, external traffic, collaborative networking, and a highly consistent schedule.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      I set and strictly maintained a structured stream schedule, built themed content with distinct visual branding, and collaborated with other streamers to mutually grow each other's audiences.
      Off-platform, I edited and published clips in DaVinci Resolve and distributed them across TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube to create inbound traffic to my Twitch channel.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintained a consistent content cadence with zero missed scheduled streams.</li>
      <li>Edited and optimized short-form and long-form content using DaVinci Resolve.</li>
      <li>Cross-promoted content across TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter to drive Twitch growth.</li>
      <li>Organized and executed collaborations with other streamers to share audiences and build community overlap.</li>
      <li>Secured high-value sponsorships with GamerSupps, Raid: Shadow Legends, HelloFresh, and Factor - converting viewers into customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reached <strong>55,000+ chat messages per month</strong>, indicating strong viewer engagement.</li>
      <li>Achieved a <strong>peak of 2,000 concurrent viewers</strong> and maintained a monthly average close to <strong>200 concurrent viewers</strong>.</li>
      <li>Grew from 0 to Twitch Partner, unlocking monetization and platform visibility.</li>
      <li>Generated sponsorship revenue and viewer conversion through affiliate partnerships and community-integrated campaigns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Growing my Twitch channel taught me the fundamentals of brand building, engagement, and iterative content strategy. 
      It was a hands-on crash course in community management, creative production, and multi-channel growth. 
      I now apply these principles to product work - focusing on user signals, audience insight, and consistent iteration.
