<h1>Headshot Gallery: Case Study</h1>
<p class="tagline">Translating visual muscle memory into a scalable content feature for FPS learners.</p>
<h2>Role &amp; Context</h2>
<p>
      As Product Manager, I led the end-to-end development of the Headshot Gallery feature, a scalable content system designed to improve player performance by providing visual references for ideal crosshair placement.
      This initiative aimed to reduce the gap between in-game learning and external resources by delivering contextual, high-retention educational assets.
    </p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
      Players especially at beginner to intermediate levels struggled with crosshair discipline and lacked a reliable way to internalize where to aim for consistent headshots.
      Most solutions required watching lengthy videos or sifting through community forums with mixed-quality content and no visual standard.
    </p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
      I scoped and delivered a searchable Headshot Gallery that showcased precise visual aiming guides, categorized by map, angle, and cover.
      I worked cross-functionally with content creators, UX, and engineering to streamline asset production, implement mobile-friendly browsing, and enforce consistent UI overlays for clarity and brand alignment.
    </p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Defined MVP scope and prioritized features to reduce content creation overhead while maximizing player value.</li>
<li>Created a production pipeline that enabled rapid delivery of <strong>500+ annotated images</strong> across core maps.</li>
<li>Worked with UX to design a lightweight tagging system for locations, angles, and user intent (e.g. peek vs hold).</li>
<li>Implemented a continuous feedback loop from community Discord channels to guide iteration and discover edge cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Increased time-on-page by <strong>45%</strong> on educational content after gallery launch.</li>
<li>Achieved <strong>95% satisfaction</strong> score in post-launch surveys with target user segment.</li>
<li>Earned widespread praise in player communities for being “simple but game-changing.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
      The Headshot Gallery reinforced the power of building for clarity and speed. By removing friction and surfacing actionable insights visually, we helped players form better muscle memory without increasing cognitive load.
      As PM, I learned how tightly scoping MVP and investing in scalable content workflows can unlock high-impact, evergreen experiences.
