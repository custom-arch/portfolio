<h1>Blitz.gg Valorant Lineups: Case Study</h1>
<p class="tagline">From concept to 1,000+ videos - delivering competitive insights to millions.</p>
<h2>Role &amp; Context</h2>
<p>
      As a Product Manager at Blitz.gg, I led strategy and agile delivery for a platform with over 2.5M monthly users. 
      Our goal was to enhance the Valorant player experience by providing highly curated lineup videos directly within the desktop app. 
    </p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
      Players struggled to find reliable, in-context lineup guides without tabbing out to YouTube or Reddit. 
      The lack of embedded, high-quality educational content created friction for both casual and competitive users.
    </p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
      We built a new feature that delivered curated Valorant lineup videos, categorized by agent, map, and utility type, directly within the Blitz desktop client. 
      I collaborated with our UX team to design a branded overlay system, which included the Blitz logo, animated transitions, and unique visual formats for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person POVs.
    </p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Directed the full product lifecycle for 15+ features, focusing on this video overlay and playback experience.</li>
<li>Led backlog refinement across 3 cross-functional teams (product, content, engineering) to prioritize impactful releases.</li>
<li>Used agile ceremonies and user feedback loops to iterate rapidly and ship updates weekly.</li>
<li>Implemented streamlined review cycles and workflows that cut content production time by 30%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scaled the lineup library from 0 to over <strong>1,000 videos</strong> across agents and maps.</li>
<li>Increased platform engagement by <strong>40%</strong> among tactical players using lineup features.</li>
<li>Improved sprint throughput by <strong>25%</strong> and reduced triage time by <strong>40%</strong>.</li>
<li>Achieved <strong>95% on-time release success</strong> across lineup-related updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
      This project reinforced how design, iteration, and velocity are interconnected. 
      By creating strong alignment between product, UX, and content teams, we delivered a feature that truly empowered competitive players. 
      It taught me the value of MVP scoping, cross-team feedback loops, and keeping visual polish aligned with brand identity.
