    <h1>Blitz.gg Product Delivery & Content Engine – Case Study</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Redefining go-to-market speed and scaling content pipelines across multiple games.</p>

    <h2>Role & Context</h2>
    <p>
      As a Product Manager at Blitz.gg, I oversaw the full delivery pipeline for game-integrated features across Valorant, League of Legends, and CS:GO.
      In parallel, I led the development of an internal content engine that scaled our production of educational and gameplay-enhancing media across millions of users.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      With multiple feature teams working in parallel, our delivery timelines became bottlenecked by unclear ownership, cross-dependencies, and manual content workflows.
      Video and UI content were produced ad hoc, leading to delays and inconsistent quality across launches.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      I introduced a structured delivery framework with standardized rituals, sprint planning, and QA phases across product, engineering, and content teams.
      Additionally, I designed and operationalized a scalable content engine an internal system for templated production, review, and publishing across multiple game titles.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebuilt agile delivery cadence with bi-weekly sprint reviews, DRI ownership assignments, and integrated release QA gates.</li>
      <li>Created a shared roadmap board with GitHub integration to align product, content, and engineering deliverables in real-time.</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented an end-to-end content production workflow using Notion, Slack, and Google Drive to reduce manual ops.</li>
      <li>Worked with leadership to forecast resourcing needs based on upcoming game releases and feature complexity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased sprint throughput by <strong>28%</strong> across three cross-functional teams.</li>
      <li>Reduced average feature delivery time by <strong>36%</strong> quarter over quarter.</li>
      <li>Scaled content creation to support <strong>3x the volume</strong> with <strong>no increase</strong> in headcount.</li>
      <li>Enabled simultaneous launches across Valorant, League, and CS with <strong>95% on-time delivery</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This initiative highlighted the importance of systems thinking in product operations. By treating content like code—with reusable patterns, QA, and iteration—we unlocked a new velocity tier for product delivery.
      Building trust between content and engineering teams proved essential, and this alignment became a cornerstone of future launches.
